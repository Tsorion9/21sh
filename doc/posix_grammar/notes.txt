1) We expect more input if pipeline is last character of the string
Example: 
ls |
> cat

2) We removed some grammars containing exactly 1 rule for nonterminal.
Why did we need them?

3) Mulitiple '\n' can be used as a command separator. How will it work in 
interactinve mode???

4) Removed left recursion.

5) Added some tokens from POSIX (bang, clobber)
